Instructions: 

Summarize results in Rmarkdown document, submitted separately from the R package. Aim for Introduction to the dataset and the question, a Methods section with any important pre-processing etc., three sections of Results (which may also contain some method details), and Discussion about interpretation or possible future directions.

R package and Rmd details:

R package and Rmd file should be runnable by instructors (unless data has privacy restrictions, in which case we can arrange an exception). Analyses are contained in Rmd file itself and should not reside in the R package.  The R package will be turned in separately as part of your group repository, and your Rmd file should utilize the R package. Your Rmd should start by loading your package. You can point out where to download data, you donâ€™t necessarily need to contain in a data/ directory in the package, especially if it very large. The R package should have man pages for any functions that are exported. The R package should pass build/check as shown in class (ask if you have questions about this).

## 1 (i) Background
Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for over 700,000 deaths each year and posing a significant healthcare burden [1]. Accurate and early detection of heart disease is essential for improving patient outcomes, with implications for treatment plans, medication strategies, and lifestyle modifications. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as stress testing and electrocardiography (ECG), provide detailed, valuable insights of possible signals for the presence of heart disease. Thus, integrating this data together can enhance heart disease identification. The objective of our project is to develop a data-driven approach to predict the presence or severity of heart disease.

## 1 (ii) Data
To accomplish this objective, we will analyze a publicly available dataset collected by the Cleveland Clinic between 1981 and 1984. This dataset includes 303 patients with or without heart disease, and includes a variety of their demographic features (e.g. age and sex) and clinical features (e.g. resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, chest pain, and response to exercise) on which to train a predictive model. Specifically, the heart disease outcome of interest is a categorical value with 0 being no heart disease and 1 to 4 being increasing heart disease severity. In our analysis we will use both the full outcome spectrum (0-4) and a simplified, binary outcome of 0 (no heart disease) and 1 (heart disease, any severity). The link to the dataset repository is found here: https://doi.org/10.24432/C52P4X. In addition to the age and sex demographic variables, the table below provides more information on the clinical variables available in the dataset.

## 2 (i) Data Preprocessing
For categorical variables, we applied one-hot encoding to convert each category into a separate binary indicator variable. After this transformation, the full model included a total of 20 predictor variables. To address potential overfitting and improve model parsimony, we employed stepwise selection based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). This approach iteratively added or removed predictors to identify a subset of variables that provided the best balance between model fit and complexity, ultimately selecting a more streamlined and interpretable model for subsequent analysis.

## 2 (ii) Logistic Regression Model
Logistic regression is a widely used statistical model for predicting a binary outcome based on a set of predictor variables. The model assumes that the log-odds of the probability of the outcome is a linear function of the predictors. Specifically, if $Y$ is a binary outcome taking values in $ \{0,1\} $ and $ \mathbf{x} $ is a vector of covariates, then the logistic regression model is given by:
$$
\log\left( \frac{\Pr(Y=1|\mathbf{x})}{\Pr(Y=0|\mathbf{x})} \right) = \mathbf{x}^\top \boldsymbol\beta
$$
where $ \boldsymbol\beta $ is the vector of regression coefficients to be estimated. The corresponding probability model is:
$$
\Pr(Y=1|\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-\mathbf{x}^\top \boldsymbol\beta)}
$$

To estimate the coefficients $ \boldsymbol\beta $, maximum likelihood estimation is employed. The likelihood function for a sample of size $n$ is:
$$
L(\boldsymbol\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{1}{1+\exp(-\mathbf{x}_i^\top \boldsymbol\beta)} \right)^{y_i} \left( \frac{\exp(-\mathbf{x}_i^\top \boldsymbol\beta)}{1+\exp(-\mathbf{x}_i^\top \boldsymbol\beta)} \right)^{1-y_i}
$$
and the log-likelihood function is:
$$
\ell(\boldsymbol\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( y_i \mathbf{x}_i^\top \boldsymbol\beta - \log\left(1+\exp(\mathbf{x}_i^\top \boldsymbol\beta)\right) \right)
$$

Because there is no closed-form solution for $ \boldsymbol\beta $ that maximizes the log-likelihood, iterative numerical methods must be used. One of the most common algorithms for this purpose is the Newton-Raphson method.

The Newton-Raphson method is a second-order optimization technique that updates the parameter estimates iteratively. At each iteration $k$, given a current estimate $ \boldsymbol\beta^{(k)} $, the next estimate $ \boldsymbol\beta^{(k+1)} $ is obtained by:
$$
\boldsymbol\beta^{(k+1)} = \boldsymbol\beta^{(k)} - \left( \nabla^2 \ell(\boldsymbol\beta^{(k)}) \right)^{-1} \nabla \ell(\boldsymbol\beta^{(k)})
$$
where $ \nabla \ell(\boldsymbol\beta^{(k)}) $ is the gradient (score function) and $ \nabla^2 \ell(\boldsymbol\beta^{(k)}) $ is the Hessian matrix (second derivative of the log-likelihood).

In logistic regression, the gradient and Hessian have specific forms. The gradient is:
$$
\nabla \ell(\boldsymbol\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \pi_i) \mathbf{x}_i
$$
where $ \pi_i = \Pr(Y=1|\mathbf{x}_i) $, and the Hessian is:
$$
\nabla^2 \ell(\boldsymbol\beta) = -\sum_{i=1}^n \pi_i (1-\pi_i) \mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{x}_i^\top
$$

Thus, each Newton-Raphson update involves solving a linear system based on the weighted sum of the covariates. The iterations continue until convergence, usually when the change in $ \boldsymbol\beta $ is smaller than a pre-specified tolerance.

In our model, we set the initial $\boldsymbol\beta$ as 0, tolerance as $10^{-3}$ and iterative times as $10^3$.

## 3 (i) Logistic Regression Model
This code output presents the variables after stepwise AIC selection, and their estimated coefficients from the logistic regression model with Newton Raphson method. It shows major vessels involved was strongly associated with the outcome, especially when two vessels were involved (ca2, coefficient = 3.183). The other major contribution to heart disease is being male (Sex = 1), which increased the log-odds by 1.398.
